## Introduction

**Windows Internals** refers to the underlying mechanisms of the Windows operating system: how it manages processes, memory, security, and system resources. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing robust, safe, and efficient system-level code—especially when using Rust's FFI to interact with Windows APIs.

---

## Core Concepts

### Processes & Threads
- **Process:** An instance of a running program, with its own memory space and resources.
- **Thread:** The smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads.

**Example:** Creating a process using the Win32 API (`CreateProcessW`).

### Memory Management
- **Virtual Memory:** Each process has its own virtual address space.
- **Heap & Stack:** Memory is divided into stack (for function calls) and heap (for dynamic allocation).
- **Page Files:** Windows uses paging to manage memory efficiently.

### Handles & Objects
- **Handle:** An opaque reference to a system resource (file, process, thread, etc.).
- **Object:** The actual resource managed by the OS.
- **Resource Management:** Always close handles when done to avoid leaks.

### Security: SIDs, ACLs, Tokens
- **SID (Security Identifier):** Uniquely identifies users, groups, or computers.
- **ACL (Access Control List):** Defines permissions for objects.
- **Token:** Represents the security context of a process or thread.

### System Calls & Win32 API
- **System Call:** A request to the OS kernel for a service.
- **Win32 API:** The primary interface for user-mode applications to interact with Windows internals.

## Practical Rust FFI Examples

### Spawning a Process (Safe Rust Abstraction)
```rust
use winix::process::spawn;

let result = spawn("C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe", &["/C", "echo", "Hello"], None);
match result {
    Ok(handle) => println!("Process launched: {:?}", handle),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to launch process: {:?}", e),
}
```
- Converts Rust strings to UTF-16 for Windows APIs.
- Manages process and thread handles safely (RAII).
- Translates Windows errors into Rust `Result` types.

### Querying System Information
```rust
use sysinfo::System;

let mut sys = System::new_all();
sys.refresh_all();
println!("Total memory: {} KB", sys.total_memory());
println!("CPU count: {}", sys.cpus().len());
```

### Safe Handle Management
```rust
use winapi::um::handleapi::CloseHandle;
use winapi::um::winnt::HANDLE;

fn close_handle_safely(handle: HANDLE) {
    if !handle.is_null() {
        unsafe { CloseHandle(handle); }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
- **FFI Safety:**
  - Minimize `unsafe` blocks and document why they are safe.
  - Validate all inputs before passing to FFI.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Use Rust’s `Result` and `std::io::Error` for comprehensive error reporting.
- **Resource Management:**
  - Use RAII (e.g., implement `Drop` for structs holding handles).
  - Always close handles, even on error paths.
- **Documentation:**
  - Comment all FFI and unsafe code.
  - Provide usage examples for contributors.
